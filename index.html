      <h1>Who's Fadel?</h1>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>
            Fadel is a multi-talented and creative individual with a deep passion for Computer Science, particularly in Theoretical Computer Science, Bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, he is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the American University of Beirut (AUB). His interests extend to Mathematics, Logic, and Philosophy, reflecting his love for intellectual exploration. Beyond his technical pursuits, Fadel is an accomplished Arabic poet who has been sharing his work at events in Lebanon since a young age. At his core, he is an enthusiastic and lifelong learner, driven by an insatiable curiosity.      </div>

          He's someone who cherishes the simple joys of life—sipping coffee while listening to the melodies of birds as the sun rises over the horizon. A true nature enthusiast, he finds peace in its beauty. In his free time, he enjoys solving Rubik’s cubes and all kinds of puzzles, diving into new topics, or creating something unique. Open-minded and thoughtful, he’s the person you turn to for deep, meaningful conversations, always striving to stay as close to the truth as possible in everything he does.        </p>

      <h3>His Computer Science Journey</h3>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>
          Fadel's journey into Computer Science began in Grade 7 when he joined his school's Arduino Club. Captivated by robotics and programming, he built a line-tracking robot that earned him a spot in the ARC-3 competition that same year. This experience ignited a deep passion for technology and problem-solving.

          Driven by curiosity and determination, Fadel embarked on a self-education journey, diving into programming and software engineering long before attending university. He independently created a range of projects, including an Arduino Smart Clock with its own operating system and a GUI-based video downloader.
          
          His dedication and self-taught expertise laid a strong foundation, which he now builds upon as he pursues a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the American University of Beirut (AUB).        </p>

          Throughout his undergraduate studies at the American University of Beirut, Fadel pursued advanced learning opportunities by taking graduate-level courses such as Advanced Data Structures and Bioinformatics. During the Advanced Data Structures course, he attempted to solve the open problem of designing an algorithm to transform a vanilla data structure into a fully persistent one with O(1)-worst-case overhead in both space and time within a pointer machine model and did some progress. Additionally, Fadel contributed to various impactful projects, including a pharmacy database system, a mental health application connecting clients with experts, and other innovative endeavors.        </p>

      <h3>His Poetic Journey</h3>
      <p>
        In Grade 8, Fadel discovered a hidden talent for Arabic poetry, developing a deep love for the art form. He realized he had the ability to write شعر عموديّ (classical Arabic poetry), and since then, he has been composing poems and immersing himself in the study of Arabic poetry and literature. His particular interests lie in Jahiliyyah poetry (الشعر الجاهليّ) and Sufi poetry (الشعر الصوفيّ). During high school, he memorized the Ten Muʻallaqāt and the diwan of Al-Muhalhel, along with many other poems, gaining a profound understanding of their analysis. Despite being a Computer Science student at AUB, he is currently enrolled in a graduate-level Arabic course called Sufi Literature as well.
